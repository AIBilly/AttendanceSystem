# AttendanceSystem
Designed and implemented a field signing system which uses the Baidu Maps APIs to locate the field staff in real time.<br>
Field staffs must complete the tasks assigned by manager within 100 meters from the task site.<br>
And the system is also equipped with a history function for manager to check the progress of the tasks.<br>
Implemented the Android client application with Android Studio, designed the UI with XML, and built a server with JHipster in IntelliJ.
